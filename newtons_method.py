        Newton's method (also known as the Newtonâ€“Raphson method), named after
        Isaac Newton and Joseph Raphson, is a method for finding successively
        better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function.
        
        Newton's method will generally give a problems if
        f'(x) = 0 when f(x) = 0

        dx_f - The derivative of the formula to find root for
        p0 - An initial approximation of the root
        tol - Acceptable error tolerence for the answer
        n0, - Maximum number of iterations before giving up
